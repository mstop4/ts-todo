# Typescript TODO App

A basic TODO checklist app done to get more comfortable with Typescript. Based on the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmrduvKl5w.

## Features

- Add tasks
- Check and uncheck tasks
- Saves task list to local storage
- Uses Github Action for deployment
- Minimalist design

## Note

This app was bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App and the Typescript template, which was deprecated almost immediately after the tutorial above was released, which is unfortunate. However, this is of little consequence as the point of this app is writing Typescript, not learning Snowpack.
